# Animation projects in python

## [Galton Board](https://github.com/Timokko/GaltonBoard/blob/master/GaltonBoard.py)
From Wikipedia:
*The bean machine, also known as the Galton Board or quincunx, is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or "regression to mediocrity".*
