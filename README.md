## [Dynamic time warping for serial correlation analysis of stock market](https://github.com/Timokko/GaltonBoard/blob/master/GaltonBoard.py)

In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data â€” indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW. A well known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. Other applications include speaker recognition and online signature recognition. It can also be used in partial shape matching application.

## [Galton Board](https://github.com/Timokko/GaltonBoard/blob/master/GaltonBoard.py)
From Wikipedia:
The bean machine, also known as the Galton Board or quincunx, is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or "regression to mediocrity".The Galton Board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs. Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs. Eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom, where the height of bead columns accumulated in the bins approximate a bell curve.

## [Lonely Runner Conjectur](https://github.com/TimoKropp/LonelyRunner/blob/master/lonely_runner.py)
From Wikipedia:
Consider *k* runners on a circular track of unit length. At *t* = 0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct. A runner is said to be lonely at time t if they are at a distance of at least *1/k* from every other runner at time *t*. The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.
