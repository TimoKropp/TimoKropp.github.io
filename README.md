## [Galton Board](https://github.com/Timokko/GaltonBoard/blob/master/GaltonBoard.py)
From Wikipedia:
*The bean machine, also known as the Galton Board or quincunx, is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or "regression to mediocrity".*

Lessons learned:  
* Using pygame for animation
* Object orientated programming
* Insights in statistics and distribution patterns

## [Lonely Runner Conjectur](https://github.com/TimoKropp/LonelyRunner/blob/master/lonely_runner.py)
From Wikipedia:
Consider *k* runners on a circular track of unit length. At *t* = 0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct. A runner is said to be lonely at time t if they are at a distance of at least *1/k* from every other runner at time *t*. The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.
