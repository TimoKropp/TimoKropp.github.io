## [Dynamic time warping for serial correlation analysis of stock market](https://github.com/TimoKropp/DTW-stock-analysis/blob/master/dtw_stock_analysis.py)

Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two time series. The data may vary in time and amplitude with example applications in analysis of temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data or any data that can be turned into a linear sequence. One of the most recent applicationns is found in automatic speech recognition coping with different speaking speeds. In this project, the DTW algorithm is used for a serial correlation analysis of stock market prices, for example the Nasdaq (NSDQ) from 2019-01 to 2020-08 as shown in the figure below.

## [Galton Board](https://github.com/Timokko/GaltonBoard/blob/master/GaltonBoard.py)
From Wikipedia:
The bean machine, also known as the Galton Board or quincunx, is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that with sufficient sample size the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or "regression to mediocrity".The Galton Board consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pegs. Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they hit the pegs. Eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom, where the height of bead columns accumulated in the bins approximate a bell curve.

## [Lonely Runner Conjectur](https://github.com/TimoKropp/LonelyRunner/blob/master/lonely_runner.py)
From Wikipedia:
Consider *k* runners on a circular track of unit length. At *t* = 0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct. A runner is said to be lonely at time t if they are at a distance of at least *1/k* from every other runner at time *t*. The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.
